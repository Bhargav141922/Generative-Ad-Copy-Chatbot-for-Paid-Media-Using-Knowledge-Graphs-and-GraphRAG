### What It Does
This project lets you ask questions like:

- **Best performing ads for [industry] in [region], top 5**  
- **Top keywords for [industry] in [region]**  
- **Explain ad by ID** (show creative text, metrics, industry/region/keyword links)  
- Free-form **“Ask Anything”** → LLM → Cypher (validated) → results with provenance  

✅ All answers are backed by explicit nodes/edges in Neo4j (no hallucinated sources).  
📊 Dataset is **synthetic** and safe to publish.
